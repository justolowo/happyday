<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.2.4</span> Basemaps</h3>
<p>The easiest way to add tiles is by calling <code>addTiles()</code> with no arguments; by default, OpenStreetMap tiles are used.</p>
<p>Alternatively, many popular free third-party basemaps can be added using the <code>addProviderTiles()</code> function, which is implemented using the leaflet-providers plugin. See <a href="http://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/index.html">here</a> for the complete set.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.2.5</span> Markers</h3>
<p>Use markers to call out points on the map. Marker locations are expressed in latitude/longitude coordinates, and can either appear as icons or as circles. You can use <code>SpatialPoints</code>, <code>SpatialPointsDataFrame</code>, or a two-column numeric matrix (first column is longitude, second column is latitude) as data objects.</p>
<p>You can also use a data frame with latitude and longitude columns. You can explicitly tell the marker function which columns contain the coorinate data (e.g. <code>addMarker(lng = ~Longitude, lat = ~Latitude)</code>), or let the function look for columns named <code>lat/latitude</code> and <code>lon/lng/long/longitude</code> (case insensitive).</p>
<div id="icon-markers" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">7.2.5.1</span> Icon Markers</h4>
<p>Icon markers are added using the <code>addMarker</code> function. Their default appearance is a dropped pin. As with most layer functions, the <code>popup</code> argument can be used to add a message to be displayed on click.</p>
